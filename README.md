# AI-Workshop-Installation-Guides

Guides for getting your machine set up with necessary software, programming languages, and scientific packages for Accel AI Technical Workshops.

It's preferred that you install Anaconda locally by following these [local installation guides](/AI-Local) to get started.

If you would prefer to use anaconda with Docker, use the following [installation guides](/AI-Docker) to get started.

If you already have an updated Anaconda distribution, simply clone the seperate workshop repository in your prefered directory, **cd** into the cloned directory, and type **jupyter notebook** in your terminal to get started.
